// This is version 1.32 - The menu on the top left is being developed as a reusable interface for each project.
// Top left menu code is now more compact, the slider values are being read from a .css data file and put into a 2 dimentional array.
// Also the checkbox value reset code is now a data loop vs 7 seperate blocks of code.
